# Algorithm Visualizer

A web-based tool for visualizing various sorting and pathfinding algorithms in action. This interactive application helps users understand how different algorithms work through visual representation.

## 🚀 Features

### Sorting Visualizer
- Visualize popular sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed
- Real-time visualization with color-coded bars
- Stop functionality for interrupting sorts

### Pathfinding Visualizer
- Visualize pathfinding algorithms:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* Search
  - Breadth First Search (BFS)
  - Depth First Search (DFS)
- Interactive grid with:
  - Draggable start and end points
  - Wall creation by clicking/dragging
  - Maze generation
  - Random wall generation
- Adjustable visualization speed
- Clear path/grid functionality

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser

## 📖 How to Use

### Sorting Visualizer
1. Select array size using the slider
2. Adjust sorting speed as needed
3. Click "Generate New Array" to create a new random array
4. Choose a sorting algorithm to visualize
5. Use the "Stop" button to interrupt the sorting process

### Pathfinding Visualizer
1. Drag start (green) and target (red) nodes to desired positions
2. Click and drag on the grid to create walls
3. Select a pathfinding algorithm from the dropdown
4. Choose visualization speed
5. Click "Visualize" to start the algorithm
6. Use "Clear Path" or "Clear Grid" to reset
